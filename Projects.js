      'The House of Providence is a permanent home for the foster youth of Michigan whose goal is to instill hope in minors who have only known the intense instability of the foster care system by allowing them to stabilize and heal in a therapeutic and familial environment. They provide several vital intervention and support services combined with individualized care and attention that afford foster children the emotional, mental, and physical security to stabilize and begin to process their difficult journey through trauma focused therapy. House of Providence provides these children with a family and support system, perhaps for the first time ever, that helps these children heal and grow into whole, independent adults realizing their full potential.',
